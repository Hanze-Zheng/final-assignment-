# Course-Capstone-Project

This is the capstone project I worked on, which was the requirement for completing the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course. 

The project is to assume the role of a corporate data analyst and to solve problems with a provided dataset, in order to test learnerâ€™s analytical skills, 
Python language proficiency and general understanding of the day-to-day work of a data analyst. 

The dataset provided is a subset of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019. The original dataset encompassed 90,000 responses and the subset used for 
this project is one tenth of that. 

Module 1: Explore the dataset.

Module 2: Data wrangling.

Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis.

Module 4: SQL and Plots.

Module 5: Dashboard.
(IBM Cognos Analysis was the required application for Module 5, for which I was provided a trial account. It did not come with permalink function, hence 
the file updated here is a PDF file of graphs of the dashboard I created)

Module 6: Findings and presentation for stakeholders.

Thank you for taking time to view my project.
